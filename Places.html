                                                    The Egyptian pyramids are ancient masonry structures located in Egypt.
                                                     Sources cite at least 118 identified "Egyptian" pyramids.
                                                     [1][2] Approximately 80 pyramids were built within the Kingdom of Kush,
                                                      now located in the modern country of Sudan. Of those located in modern Egypt,
                                                       most were built as tombs for the country's pharaohs and their consorts
                                                        during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods.[3][4][5]

                                                    The earliest known Egyptian pyramids are found at Saqqara, northwest of Memphis,
                                                     although at least one step-pyramid-like structure has been found at Saqqara,
                                                      dating to the First Dynasty: Mastaba 3808, which has been attributed to 
                                                      the reign of Pharaoh Anedjib, with inscriptions, and other archaeological 
                                                      remains of the period, suggesting there may have been others.[6] The otherwise
                                                       earliest among these is the Pyramid of Djoser built c. 2630–2610 BCE during the 
                                                       Third Dynasty.[7] This pyramid and its surrounding complex are generally considered
                                                        to be the world's oldest monumental structures constructed of dressed masonry.[8]
                                                    
                                                    The most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo.
                                                     Several of the Giza pyramids are counted among the largest structures ever built.[9]
                                                      The Pyramid of Khufu is the largest Egyptian pyramid. It is the only one of the Seven

                                                        by about 2,000 years.[10]

                                                    The Egyptian pyramids are ancient masonry structures located in Egypt.
                                                     Sources cite at least 118 identified "Egyptian" pyramids.
                                                     [1][2] Approximately 80 pyramids were built within the Kingdom of Kush,
                                                      now located in the modern country of Sudan. Of those located in modern Egypt,
                                                       most were built as tombs for the country's pharaohs and their consorts
                                                        during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods.[3][4][5]

                                                    The earliest known Egyptian pyramids are found at Saqqara, northwest of Memphis,
                                                     although at least one step-pyramid-like structure has been found at Saqqara,
                                                      dating to the First Dynasty: Mastaba 3808, which has been attributed to 
                                                      the reign of Pharaoh Anedjib, with inscriptions, and other archaeological 
                                                      remains of the period, suggesting there may have been others.[6] The otherwise
                                                       earliest among these is the Pyramid of Djoser built c. 2630–2610 BCE during the 
                                                       Third Dynasty.[7] This pyramid and its surrounding complex are generally considered
                                                        to be the world's oldest monumental structures constructed of dressed masonry.[8]
                                                    
                                                    The most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo.
                                                     Several of the Giza pyramids are counted among the largest structures ever built.[9]
                                                      The Pyramid of Khufu is the largest Egyptian pyramid. It is the only one of the Seven

                                                     Sources cite at least 118 identified "Egyptian" pyramids.
                                                     [1][2] Approximately 80 pyramids were built within the Kingdom of Kush,
                                                      now located in the modern country of Sudan. Of those located in modern Egypt,
                                                       most were built as tombs for the country's pharaohs and their consorts
                                                        during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods.[3][4][5]

                                                     although at least one step-pyramid-like structure has been found at Saqqara,
                                                      dating to the First Dynasty: Mastaba 3808, which has been attributed to 
                                                      the reign of Pharaoh Anedjib, with inscriptions, and other archaeological 
                                                      remains of the period, suggesting there may have been others.[6] The otherwise
                                                       earliest among these is the Pyramid of Djoser built c. 2630–2610 BCE during the 
                                                       Third Dynasty.[7] This pyramid and its surrounding complex are generally considered
